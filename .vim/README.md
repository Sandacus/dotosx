# Vim configuration folder

Currently using pathogen to manage plugins, as well as manually creating a colors folder.

## file structure
    |-autoload
      |-...
    |-bundle
      |-plugin-files
    |-colors
      |-colorscheme.vim files

## Colorscheme
I've been messing around with colorschemes. A few I like are;
* orbital
* farout
* monochrome
* wombat
* falcon 
* nord
I may try and write a script to easily toggle between my favourites while I decide.

## Status bar
I have got the airline plugin, but have come across lightline, which a minimilistic status bar plugin. 
I think I will replace airline with it.
Although I might try and write my own, maybe put it in its own statusline.vim file.
I found this good post about it https://gabri.me/blog/diy-vim-statusline
